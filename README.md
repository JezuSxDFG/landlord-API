 It's an express JS server.
 Once you have fixed the index.js file. Doing `npm install` and `npm run` should make the server turn on.

 If you need any help just message me on Discord(hayhaydz#8652) and I would be more than happy to assist you!
 
 You can use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) in order to monitor the traffic of an android emulator and get your Landlord user-id and fs-token.
